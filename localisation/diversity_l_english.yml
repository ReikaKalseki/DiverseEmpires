EMPIRE_DESIGN_miidari:0 "Miidari Alliance"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_miidari_desc:1 "Had history gone slightly differently, the Miidari would no longer exist to join the galactic community; in the not so distant past, an unremarkable meteorite brought with it a mysterious contamination which began to destroy their home world. Only via intensive research were they able to identify the invader, and determine that it was consuming their planet. And only through blinding technological advancement and impassionate allocation of resources were they able to throw together colonization missions to other semi-habitable planets in their star system before their own became unlivable. Miidari society and policy still remembers these events, and continues to doggedly pursue the sciences, having been convinced beyond all doubt that they hold the keys to continued survival."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_alvothari:0 "Alvothari Foundation"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_alvothari_desc:1 "The Alvothari spent millions of years of their early evolution in the oceans, hiding from predators far more powerful than themselves. This left them with two things: The ability to communicate telepathically, to avoid being overheard by those predators, and an inherent psychological bias to avoid direct confrontation, to either hide or achieve victory through more subtle and clever means. Those traits endure in the now-spacefaring Alvothari, and are reflected in the structure of their society and interactions with others."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_ikaran:0 "Hierarchy of Ikara"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_ikaran_desc:1 "The homeworld of the Ikarans is Karzu, a planet covered in dense jungle. This planet's biosphere is, and always has been, ultra-competitive and structured according to one simple principle: Kill or be killed, dominate or die. And thus so is the Ikaran psyche and society.\n\nIkarans see themselves as conquerors, as the rightful rulers of all of creation, and the violent path to achieve that is not only acceptable, but actively desirable."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_reshethi:0 "Reshethi Sovereign Provinces"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_reshethi_desc:1 "Historically, Reshethi society was largely structured around physical dominance; those who could impose their will through physical might were those whose wills were done. With the advancement of technology, however, this hierarchy broke down and the old rulers were eliminated. Those remaining restructured their society around the fundamental principle that power is distributed, and that there is no inherent value to one's personal advantages or background. Principles that they seek to demonstrate to all who they feel need it."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_raxycodium:0 "Raxycodium Covenant"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_raxycodium_desc:0 "Long ago an enterprising leader of the Raxycodium, one whose name has now taken on the reverence of a deity, made a realization: There is no need use force to hold power, or take disproportionate rewards, if the public sincerely believe you to deserve it. And so a new system of beliefs was born, one which, above all, emphasizes the supremacy of the leader caste, which are deified as a pantheon of gods. At the core of their tenets is that the bulk of all resources are best spent on them, that the suffering of the masses is a more than acceptable price to pay for the opulence of the elite."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_ruphaari:0 "Ruphaari Order"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_ruphaari_desc:1 "The Ruphaari ideology has from the beginning had elements of narcissism, of convictions that they were the apex of creation, a standard that noone else could ever approach. With the discovery that their world was unlikely to be so fine-tuned for them by chance, these ideas exploded in force, and now the Ruphaari are barely willing to even entertain the idea of working with those they consider innately inferior.\n\nUnlike some empires, however, they do not see the need to 'cleanse' the galaxy of the inferior; instead, they consider them not even worth giving thought."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_skeru:0 "Council of Skeru"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_skeru_desc:1 "For more than a thousand years, different orthodoxies of belief and policy have risen, only to fade again; pushed their way to dominance, only to be overtaken by another.\nThat all changed with the development of the newest generations of weapons; these paved the way for one faction, the precursor to the Council, to take control, and eliminate any chance of being superseded by ensuring neither the ideas nor the people remained with which to form competing ideas.\nAnd so the species was, for the first time, universally in adherence to one authority, to one doctrine, now looking skyward to find the next population to bring in line."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_syldaean:0 "Syldaeanllar Coalition"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_syldaean_desc:1 ""

EMPIRE_DESIGN_dekron:0 "Dekron Grid"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_dekron_desc:1 "The Dekron once shared their world with an organic species, one that may well have been their creators. However, the successive ravages of disease, then chaos, then war saw to it that the Dekron would inherit the planet alone.\n\nThey took to the stars, seeking more forms of life with which to interact, and, if necessary, prevent from the same fate that befell their progenitors, whether from outside sources or from their own mistakes."

civic_cult:0 "Blind Devotion"
civic_cult_desc:0 "Whether through sheer force of personality, outright coercion, brainwashing, or the use of chemical influence, the leader of this country is obeyed and worshipped without question.\n\nDissent need not be fought against, because it never arises in the first place. Their subjects do not question their leader and will give anything - including their own lives - to bring their will to fruition.\n\nIt is, of course, necessary to take special care to allow few the knowledge or power to compete with the leader, and this lack of divergent thought somewhat impedes innovation."
